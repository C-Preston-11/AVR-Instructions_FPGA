Using an FPGA (Altera Quartus II Cyclone) to model an AVR microcontroller, 4 instructions were added to the existing design - without changing the previous commands. 

Instructions implemented 
MUL - Multiply
MULS - Multiply Signed
MULSU - Multiply Signed and Unsigned
NEG - Twos compliement

The instruction set included demonstrated all the added instructions, as well as previous functions.
