This project used a FPGA (Altera Quartus II Cyclone) replicated AVR microcontroller, 4 instructions were added to the existing design - without changing the previous commands. 

Instructions implemented 
MUL - Multiply,
MULS - Multiply Signed,
MULSU - Multiply Signed and Unsigned,
NEG - Twos compliement,

The instruction set included demonstrated all the added instructions, as well as previous functions.
