This project added multiple instructions to an AVR microcontroller architecture that was built using an FPGA board. The instructions needed to be implimented without altering the already available instructions.

Instructions implemented:

MUL - Multiply

MULS - Multiply Signed

MULSU - Multiply Signed and Unsigned

NEG - Twos compliement

The instruction set included demonstrated all the added instructions, as well as previous functions.
